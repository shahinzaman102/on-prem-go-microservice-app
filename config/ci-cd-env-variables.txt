Note: - We can set the Visibility to "Masked" to hide the variable which will avoid printing the variable to the ci/cd pipeline logs.
      - If we keep the Visibility as default selected which is "Visible", then it can be revealed to the ci/cd pipeline logs.
	      but when "Visible" if the project is Private then there's shouldn't be any issue.
	  - And if we find issue to "Masked" the variable, then we can increase the character length to 8 or more..
	  - The variables which are used - most of them are the default credentials for the respective services - so we'll have to be careful - 
	    when we want to change any variable "Key" or "Value" from here below - we can get access issue later after port-forwarding...

MAIL_PASSWORD : password

MAIL_USERNAME : johnsmith

MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD : password

MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME : admin

PGADMIN_PASSWORD : admin

PGADMIN_USER : admin@example.com

POSTGRES_DB : users

POSTGRES_PASSWORD : password

POSTGRES_USER : postgres

USER_EMAIL : admin@example.com

USER_PASSWORD : use the "Base64 encode" form of the below password : 
				$2a$12$1zGLuYDDNvATh4RA4avbKuheAMpb1svexSzrQm7up.bnpwQHs0jNe

To encode the "USER_PASSWORD" in Base64 :

	- In Terminal 🡪 

		echo -n '$2a$12$1zGLuYDDNvATh4RA4avbKuheAMpb1svexSzrQm7up.bnpwQHs0jNe' | base64

	- We’ll get something like in output 🡪

		JDJhJDEyJDF6R0x1WURETnZBVGg0UkE0YXZiS3VoZUFNcGIxc3ZleFN6clFtN3VwLmJucHdRSHMwak5l
	
	- Then, Set this "output" as the "Value" for the "Key: USER_PASSWORD" in CI/CD.
